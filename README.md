Project Overview
The Restaurant Reservation System project is a console application developed in .NET Core 5.0+ using Entity Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database. It follows an organized architecture with data models, repository classes, and asynchronous LINQ queries. The project is hosted on GitHub, with each phase committed following Git best practices.

Features
CRUD Operations: Provides create, update, and delete methods for each entity.
Repository Pattern: Each entity has a repository for separation of concerns.
Asynchronous Operations: LINQ operations are asynchronous, improving performance.
Database Views: Retrieves reservation and employee data from pre-defined views.
Database Functions: Calculates total revenue by restaurant.
Stored Procedures: Identifies customers with reservations over a specified party size.
Data Seeding: Populates tables with initial records for testing.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK 5.0 or later
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for creating the database
Git for version control
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/RestaurantReservation.git
cd RestaurantReservation
Step 2: Set Up the Database
Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Create a database named RestaurantReservationCore.
Update the connection string in RestaurantReservationDbContext to point to your SQL Server instance.
Step 3: Build the Project
bash
dotnet build
Step 4: Apply Migrations and Seed the Database
bash
dotnet ef database update
This command will apply the migrations and seed the database with initial data.

Database Schema
The project follows a structured database schema with tables for Customers, Employees, Reservations, Orders, MenuItems, and Restaurants. The relationships between tables include foreign keys and navigation properties.
